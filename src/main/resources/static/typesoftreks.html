Daily treks average up to 6.2 miles a day for up to 5 days. Physical conditioning is recommended. Altitude conditioning is recommended as altitude sickness can occur around 8,200 feet. </p>
<p><span class="headings">Moderate:</span> Moderate treks can reach altitudes up to 10,826 feet. The average walking time per day is 5 to 6 hours.Inclines and declines vary all the way to 1,969 feet.

<p><span class="headings">Strenuous:</span> Strenuous treks can reach altitudes up to 18,438 feet. The average walking/hiking time is 7- 8 hours (with a few days up to 10 hours) per day. On some routes, over 16,404 feet are traversed. Steep and difficult terrain is common. Altitude differences of up to 3,280 feet are possible. Daily hikes will cover 6.2 - 9.3 miles with a total trekking duration of up to 3 weeks. Some rest days are included. Physical conditioning is strongly recommended. A modest level of altitude training should occur at least a month prior to trek.

An average walking / hiking time of 6 to 10 hours a day is to be expected. Various terrains will be traversed. Several high passes over 16,404 feet are traversed. These high passes can be covered in snow under certain treks. Steep and difficult terrain with altitude differences of up to 3,280 feet are to be expected. Climbing gear such as ropes, ice axes and crampons (ice shoes) may be necessary. Anticipate trails that lead to remote areas where the roads are in bad condition. Daily treks/hikes cover 6.2 - 9.3 miles with a trekking duration of up to 22 days. Rest days are included.
